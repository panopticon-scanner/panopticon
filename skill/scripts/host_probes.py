"""Establish what a host actually delivers, as opposed to what it claims.

`hosts.py` is the table of claims and stays I/O-free. This module is where the
filesystem and subprocess live, so it is imported only by the driver's
pre-phase step and by setup -- never by `phases/*` on the hot path, and never
by `hosts.py` (that import would break the purity guard).

Every probe returns `(state, by, detail)`:

  state   one of hosts.PROVEN / hosts.REFUTED / hosts.UNKNOWN
  by      the probe id that produced it, or None when nothing ran
  detail  a sentence a human can act on, naming paths where paths matter

A probe that CANNOT RUN returns UNKNOWN with the reason -- never a guess, and
never `proven` by default. UNKNOWN and REFUTED are different answers: unknown
means nobody looked, refuted means we looked and the control is not there.
Confusing the two is the failure this whole spec exists to prevent.

No probe may touch live state. Anything that needs to arm, install or write
does it inside a `tempfile.TemporaryDirectory()`.
