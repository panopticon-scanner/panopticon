"""#1697: the argv SHAPES a workflow `run:` step writes, with no rule on top.

Split out of `scripts/workflow_guard.py` the way `scripts/shell_reader.py` was
(#1647 fix round 1), and for the same reason: closing four of that module's
documented gaps pushed it past the house's module size, and the part that came
out is a layer, not a slice. `shell_reader` turns text into statements and
argv; this module answers the argv questions that have nothing to do with
supply chains, and `workflow_guard` asks the two that do.

Three questions live here, each one a shape a step writes down:

    what a fetcher was told    compatibility imports from workflow_fetch,
                               the single owner of bounded transfer parsing
    what an operand stands for `same_file`, `names_file` and `covers`: exactly,
                               by a glob, by the directory a recursive command
                               walks; and `described`, for the operands handed
                               over by `find -exec` or `xargs`. The guard binds
                               a use to a download by NAME, and shell has
                               several ways to designate a file without ever
                               writing its name
    where a script hides       `scripts` finds the shell handed to `eval` or
                               `sh -c` as a STRING, which is the same act one
                               quote away from a substitution; `in_container`
                               the operand a `docker run` hands to a shell on
                               the far side of a bind mount
    whether a failure matters  `swallowed` reads the separator, the `!` and
                               the `if`/`while` around a command, and `regions`
                               the branch bodies it was written inside -- the
                               two ways the shell says an exit status will not
                               stop the script
