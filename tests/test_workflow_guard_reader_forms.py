"""#2331, batch 3: the command and program forms the guard's reader missed.

Each class is one sub-issue of the epic: a spelling in which bash runs a
download -- bash 3.2.57 and GNU bash 5.2.21, every checksum failing -- that
the guard read clean, pinned as a live step, beside the controls that must
read as they did. The reader's own halves are in `tests/test_shell_reader.py`
